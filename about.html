		<h4><b>What we do!</b></h4>
		
		
		IT Training Hub is an IT – Training, Consulting, Engineering and Services Company grounded in the accessing and dissemination of IT training. It is an IT (Programming/Cloud) company that integrates modern 
		skills and technology with Cloud Computing Operations in the Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS), Platform as a Service
		(PaaS) and Software as a Service(SaaS) cloud solutions for best results oriented workloads.<p></p>
		
		IT Training Hub approach is primarily focused on fostering close relationships with clients and customers in providing services such as
		ICT Training, Support and Consultancy services in addition to the numerous programming and cloud services being rendered. Our 
		operations cut across all levels of Computer Training ranging from beginner to advanced. We offer courses such as Computer applications

		Containers/Kubernetes management and deployments, as well as cloud Serverless and Microservices architectures.
        <p><p/>
        Remarkably, at our Computer Training site, we offer real certification practice questions and study tests for a lot of skills in
		a variety of fields, from different cloud fundamental certification exams to Project Management — that’s because we believe 
		taking practice tests is the most valuable step a professional can do when preparing for a certification exam (in the IT 
		certification field or otherwise). But even taking practice questions is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of exam prep.
